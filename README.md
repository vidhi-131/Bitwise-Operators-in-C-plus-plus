# Bitwise-Operators-in-cpp:

Aim: To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Tool: VS Code

# Theory:
Bitwise operators directly perform operations on binary representations of integers. These operators manipulate individual bits of data, enabling efficient computation especially useful in low-level programming, optimization, and hardware-level tasks. The two provided programs demonstrate bitwise manipulation using various operators.

# Basic Bitwise Operations:

AND (&): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns 1 only if both bits are 1.
OR (|): Compares each bit and returns 1 if either of the bits is 1.
NOT (~): Inverts each bit of the number, turning 1 into 0 and 0 into 1, also known as complement.
XOR (^): Returns 1 if the corresponding bits of operands are different.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits of a number to the left, effectively multiplying the number by powers of 2.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, effectively dividing the number by powers of 2.

# Bit Manipulation (Setting and Resetting Bits)

Setting a Bit: To set (turn on) a particular bit, the program uses OR (|) with a left-shifted mask where the desired bit is set to 1. This ensures that the target bit is set without affecting other bits.

Resetting a Bit: To reset (turn off) a bit, the program uses AND (&) with the complement of the left-shifted mask, ensuring only the targeted bit is cleared.

# Program 1
Algorithm:

Start

Initialize integers a = 13, b = 14

Perform and store results of:

a & b → AND

a | b → OR

~a and ~b → NOT

a ^ b → XOR

a << 1, b << 1 → Left Shift

a >> 1, b >> 1 → Right Shift

Print all results

End

# Program 2: Bit Set and Reset
Algorithm:

Start

Initialize integer a = 230

Input bit position to set → bit_set

Set bit using a | (1 << bit_set)

Input bit position to reset → bit_reset

Reset bit using a & (~(1 << bit_reset))

Print results of both operations

End

`Conclusion`: Hence, we performed the Bitwise Operations on numbers given as input and we have reset and set the given digits of a binary number.
